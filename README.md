Take ownership of your code.

Knowing who owns a project or section of a code base is very helpful when asking questions or requesting feedback. This gem allows developers to define `OWNERS` files throughout their repository to provide a human and machine readable way to determine who the maintainers are for specific files of code.

These files can be used to:

* find the right people to ask when you have questions
* notify maintainers when changes occur in the files that they care about
* enforce approval from the appropriate people in pull requests


## Installation

```
gem install owners
```


## Usage

Define an `OWNERS` file in any directory within your repository. This file should contain a newline separated list of subscribers to notify when files within the directory have changed. The `OWNERS` files are searched recursively up the tree to make organizing owners more convenient.

Subscribers can be anything that suits your needs e.g. emails, GitHub handles, Slack channels, etc.

```
bob@your-org.com
jane@your-org.com
@some_github_handle
@your_github_org/group
#some_slack_channel
```

#### Filters

The `OWNERS` file also supports filtering paths with regular expressions. Any whitespace between these filters and their corresponding subscribers is ignored.

```
@data         app/models/.*
@ui           \.(css|haml|js|scss)$
bob@demo.com  lib/bobs_special_file.rb
#whitespace   path/with spaces/is all part/of the filter.txt
```

#### Multiple subscribers

Subscribers can be listed multiple times in an `OWNERS` file.

```
@data app/models
@data db
```

Multiple comma separated subscribers can be listed for the same filter.

```
@data,@team-leads db
```

#### Comments

Comments are supported by prefixing lines with `//`.

```
// this comment will be ignored
//// this one two
  // even this one with whitespace

@data,@team-leads db

#internal .env
```

#### Finding owners

Find the owners for specific files by passing them to the `Owners.for` method.
This returns an array of `Owner` objects which are simple wrappers around
`String` with a few extra methods.

```ruby
owners = Owners.for("db/schema.rb", ".env") #=> ["@data", "#internal"]
```

The owner's `type` can be one of `%i(alert email group label mention tag)`.

```ruby
owners.first.type #=> :mention
owners.last.type  #=> :tag
```

The `paths` method returns an array of owned file paths that triggered the match.

```ruby
owners.first.paths #=> ["db/schema.rb"]
owners.last.paths  #=> [".env"]
```

The `subscriptions` method allows us to inspect the rules that triggered a match.

```ruby
owners.each do |owner|
  puts owner

  owner.subscriptions.each do |path, subscriptions|
    puts "  #{path}"

    subscriptions.each do |subscription|
      puts "  #{subscription.file}:#{subscription.line} => #{subscription.filter}"
    end
  end
end
```

```
@data
  db/schema.rb
  OWNERS:5 => (?-mix:db)
#internal
  .env
  OWNERS:7 => (?-mix:.env)
```

#### Finding files without owners

Stay on top of owner subscriptions by finding files that don't have any owners yet.

```ruby
Owners.missing_for(".env", "some/other/file.rb") #=> ["some/other/file.rb"]
```

#### Git diff integration

To find the owners for files changed with `git diff` use the `Owners.for_diff` method.

```ruby
Owners.for_diff("your-feature-branch-or-ref", "optional-base-ref-defaults-to-master")
```


## Command line interface

This gem also comes with a convenient `owners` CLI. Each owner is printed out and separated by newlines.

```bash
owners for .env app/controllers/posts_controller.rb app/models/user.rb
```

```
#infrastructure
@api/internal
@data
```

#### Debugging and managing subscriptions

The `--debug` option outputs additional information for subscriptions.

```bash
owners for --debug .env app/controllers/posts_controller.rb app/models/user.rb
```

```
#infrastructure
tag
  .env
  OWNERS:1 => (?-mix:\.env)

@api/internal
group
  app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
  OWNERS:2 => (?-mix:app/(controllers|models))

  app/models/user.rb
  OWNERS:2 => (?-mix:app/(controllers|models))

@data
mention
  ./app/models/user.rb
  ./OWNERS:3 => (?-mix:app/models)
```

#### Git diff integration

The `git diff` integration works in the command line as well.

```bash
owners for_diff my-feature-branch
```

See `owners help` for more information.

Take ownership of your code.

Knowing who owns a project or section of a code base is very helpful when asking questions or requesting feedback. This gem allows developers to define `OWNERS` files throughout their repository to provide a human and machine readable way to determine who the maintainers are for specific files of code.

These files can be used to:

* find the right people to ask when you have questions
* notify maintainers when changes occur in the files that they care about
* enforce approval from the appropriate people in pull requests


## Installation

```
gem install owners
```


## Usage

Define an `OWNERS` file in any directory within your repository. This file should contain a newline separated list of subscribers to notify when files within the directory have changed. The `OWNERS` files are searched recursively up the tree to make organizing owners more convenient.

Subscribers can be anything that suits your needs e.g. emails, GitHub handles, Slack channels, etc.

```
bob@your-org.com
jane@your-org.com
@some_github_handle
@your_github_org/group
#some_slack_channel
```

The `OWNERS` file also supports limiting paths with regular expressions. Any whitespace that separates the subscriber from the path limiters is ignored.

```
@data         app/models/.*
@ui           \.(css|haml|js|scss)$
bob@demo.com  lib/bobs_special_file.rb
```

Find the owners for specific files by passing them to the `Owners.for` method.

```ruby
Owners.for(".env", "app/controllers/posts_controller.rb", "app/models/user.rb")
```

This works well when comparing the files changed between `git` branches.

```ruby
files = `git diff --name-only master`.split("\n")
Owners.for(*files)
```

This method returns a unique array of all the owners who have subscribed to changes for the specified files. These subscribers can then be notified however you see fit!


## CLI

This gem also comes with a convenient `owners` command line interface. Each owner is printed out and separated by newlines.

```bash
owners for .env app/controllers/posts_controller.rb app/models/user.rb
```

See `owners help` for more information.
